[color="#1E90FF"][B]Additional Info:[/B][/COLOR]
Athena uses no injection or hooking methods whatsoever. Due to the fact that the greater majority of 'deciding factor' proactive antivirus-detections are because of injection, this bot bypasses nearly all antivirus-proactives. The lack of injecting and hooking systemwide does not mean you are losing bots. Athena accounts for itself in many ways and will trump most bots on the market in keeping control of a bot machine. If the binary is kept FUD, your bots will stay alive and stable a long time.
