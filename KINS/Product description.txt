After collecting the config files is issued shall be issued 3 - dropper.exe, bot32.dll, bot64.dll and just as you do is file softwaregrabber.dll,
which has already been assembled independently of the first three .

dropper.exe - dropper file ( 50 kb ), which pulls the core bot (2 cores , bot32.dll and bot64.dll). This file is crypted .

bot32.dll - kernel for 32-bit systems .....
: > kriptovat is not necessary . Avtokript memory . The modules are the basis of the bot and are responsible for the processes of injection and grabbing a browser .
bot64.dll - kernel for 64 -bit systems .....

softwaregrabber.dll - module port opening . Responsible for grabbing FTP \ Email \ pop3 \ Billing \ screen and check otstuk kernel modules. Kriptovat is not necessary . Avtokript memory .

The core of the bot. RULE OF COMMUNICATIONS AND DOWNLOADS . Pay special attention .

- Adding a file in the " Files" section. As jobs are added files bot32.dll, bot64.dll, softwaregrabber.dll and other modules , including third-party dll or exe files .
Name and version selected as desired. Bot communicates with the modules Zutick, Shylock, SpyEye, but without an open API ( optional) argument to leave empty.
Attention ! Communication with the module . First, load the kernel modules . In this case, the kernel modules should not be linked to anything . Next, load the module softwaregrabber.dll,
that should be associated with bot32.dll

- Give the job to the modules in the " job ." It should be noted key points : a) To select the kernel module loading mode " reusable "
Module softwaregrabber - " one-off " or " reusable " . b) Number of times (performance ) put a big number, eg 9999999 .

- Quest " written in the config ", " input commands manually " are available only when you open API. Setting the "send logs " is available only for debug version,
which is done by request and in extreme cases. In this case, the installation logs dropper and obtaining rights go to the " logs " .

- Net \ dirty - a necessary attribute if you decide to download the bots in one hand.

- Updating the dll is on the circuit i +1 preserving the bot name in the files and assignments , if necessary update of sequence, and the scheme i, if the update
comes after the reboot .

- To update the statistics in the admin dropper , do not forget to add the task to CZK .

- The difference between the admin area "A" and "B" indicates the quality of your traffic. Cores bot ticking only after obtaining logs . In case
progruzhaetya kernel , say, Dedic , where there is no activity , the bot will appear in the admin "B" , but did not appear in the admin area "A".
You can always see the number of loaded cores bot in the " jobs " in the admin dropper . The difference in bad trafe may reach 90 %
we only show the balance of objective things.

1 ) Find a server, it is desirable to Windows ( you can Dedicated Server with installed apache / nginx / xamp / denwer, in general, need a server
